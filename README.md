# Twistribution

Twisting probability distributions.

The idea is to be able to perform operations on independent random variables drawn from probability distributions without having to drop down to sampling.

There should be as few non-dev dependencies as possible (for example, no dependency on numpy, scipy, etc.).

Contributions are welcome!
